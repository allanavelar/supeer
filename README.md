# Super P2P Server

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/d14na/supeer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/d14na/supeer)

> NOTE: The primary purpose of this package is to facilitate seeding from peers *(especially on mobile devices)* located behind a corporate NAT or firewall.

## TCP Communications

    Default Port: 15441

## Gateways

Proxy gateways will be provided for free to the following decentralized networks:

1. [TOR - The Onion Router](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network))
2. [I2P - Invisible Internet Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I2P)

## NAT Seeding *(WIP)*

1. *(Mobile)* client establishes a reverse proxy connection to a SUPeer *(running TURN services).*
2. Client listens/handles requests via the SUPeer's tunnel and seeding occurs as normal.
